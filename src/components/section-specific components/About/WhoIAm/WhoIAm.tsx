        A passionate Full Stack Developer, with production-level work experience
        and a flair to collaborate effectively within teams. My professional
        journey extends beyond my programming skills, encompassing a diverse
        background that includes a solid foundation in biochemical research,
        entrepreneurial experience as a business owner, and analytical acumen
        honed during my military service as an aerial imagery analyst. Just like
        I learned German on my own and moved from Israel to Austria, when I set
        my mind to something, I make it happen.
