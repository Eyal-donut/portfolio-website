        A passionate Full Stack Developer, with production-level work experience
        and a flair to collaborate within teams. My professional journey extends
        beyond my programming skills, encompassing a diverse background that
        includes biochemical research in breast cancer, entrepreneurial experience as a business
        owner, and analytical acumen honed during my military service in the Israeli intelligence unit. Just like I learned German on my own, moved from
        Israel to Austria and got my degree in German, when I set my mind to
        something, I make it happen.
