Plans programming for myself:

1. Update link-in (as it is in the contact of my website)

2. My portfolio website: eyal-lila:

2.1. Fix Pokemon game - make heal more effective, fix the fact that weaker pokemons do more damage, make the other attack equally strong.

2.2. For both projects: Create a project page component, that has all the info from the project portfolio pdf.

2.3. For both pages - do a video that shows what's going on in the game, that will run automatically on the project page.
